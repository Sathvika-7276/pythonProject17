regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your 
accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
My accuracy was okay during the start of the practicals but week by week the difficulty of practicals 
increased and so my estimates are not very accurate. However, overall I have improved my accuracy during
course of the subject.

regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
Going through other peers code and giving them reviews was a lot of learning experience as it
gives me an opportunity to improve my own code as well as spotting any mistakes also sets a reminder 
for me to not make those mistakes as well.

regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
The time given for the submission of weekly practicals should be reduced so that students are more
likely to do the practicals right after the lecture.
